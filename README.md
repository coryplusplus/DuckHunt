# Duck Hunt ![](https://coryplusplus.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/duckflying.gif)

Video games were a huge motivation and the reason I chose to become a software developer.

If you are anything like me, learning to code was most fun when I was working on games!

When I was in college (10+ years ago) final project in my first ever Java class was to code a game.

I chose DuckHunt!

I want to share with you the source code of the game DuckHunt written solely in Java using Java AWT Events and Java Swing.

Please make the code better, clean it up, add new images, etc.
Have fun with it.

I hope it helps you on your learning journey
